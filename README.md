Introduction
--------------------

Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) is a technique used in approximate nearest-neighbor search.  For large datasets, searching the entire dataset for candidate near neighbors for a query point is often prohibitively expensive.  LSH uses hash functions that have a tendency to hash similar points to similar buckets and dissimilar points to dissimilar buckets, thereby reducing the set of points to consider in the nearest-neighbor search (Indyk and Motwani).

We implement a variant of LSH for cosine similarity.  In particular, we follow the discussions in Charikar (2002) and Ravichandran, et al. (2005).

Our implementation is divided into two parts, and indexer and a searcher.
